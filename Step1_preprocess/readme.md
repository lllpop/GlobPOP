The data preprocessing consists of two steps, data harmonization and linear gapfill. 

The harmonization process includes the raster data conversions and census data regulations. 

Considering the gaps in different population products are between five to ten years, we took the linear population growth assumptions to fill the data gaps. 
The linear gapfill process included linear interpolation and extrapolation at the pixel level.
