The key point of the data fusion framework is to fully comprehend and exploit the strengths and weaknesses of the five input population products,
contributing them to the regression model of population fusion. 

Thus, we performed the clustering analysis allowed for understanding the differences in each population data setâ€™s performance across 
countries. And then the estimation model was established through statistical learning and training regression parameters on the regions with
better performance.
